"Objectives: To understand   arrays in C#. 

 

Problem description: 

Create one console application ConsoleAnimal 

Declare an array MyArray of size 5 in MAIN method, which will take five names of animal. 

i.e.  

{"Zebra","Ant","Owl","Lion"} 

 

Write a program  to print the above MyArray in the sequence given above by using following  

Loops. 

For loop. 

Foreach loop. 

Do While loop. 

While loop. 

 

Also display the same array list in sorted order i.e. alphabetically. 

 

Declare two more string arrays  “animals” and “places” which will take following  entries 

 {"Zebra","Kiwi","Amazona Parrot","Tiger"} 

  

{"Africa","New Zealand","Jamaica","India"}  

 

Respectively. Display them one by one after sorting them by order using foreach loop.

ASSIGNMENT 2 

Objectives: 

 

To understand Abstract Class 

To understand Interface  

 

Problem Description:  

 

Create an interface IVolume which has following methods. 

which contains read-only property which returns double as Volume 

double Volume{get;} 

 

Create an interface IArea with method SurfaceArea() with returns double. 

 

Create an interface ISolid which inherits the above interfaces. 

 

Create an Abstract class  Class Solid which implements ISolid  

            Add two attributes as  

radius               -----double 

pi   = 3.142       -----Constant double 

             

            Create public readonly property of Volume as  

      public abstract double Volume 

       { 

         get; 

       } 

         

             Declare an Abstract Method of Interface in it. 

             Create a Constructor of Class Solid. 

             Create Public Properties for attributes; 

 

Create a Concrete Class Cylinder which derives from Class SOLID  

with Attributes double height  - 

  

Volume =  pi * Radius * Radius * height; 

Surface Area = 2 * pi * Radius * (Radius + height) 

     

        Override the Property Volume & pass the Formula to it which will return Volume. 

        Show appropriate implementation method SurfaceArea () 

Create Appropriate Constructors for Class Cylinder 

 

       

Create a Class Sphere which inherits from class solid  

 

Create a Constructor which will take parameters from base class. 

Override method which will return surface area using Formula 

  (4 / 3) * pi * Radius * Radius * Radius; 

Override Property Volume which will calculate the Sphere  

 Using following formula 

                         4 * pi * Radius * Radius; 

 

In Class Program 

       

       Create a Static Method which will take ISolid object reference  

    As a input variable. Method will give output of Volume & Surface  

    Of Cylinder & Sphere.  

    

           In Main Method Create the Object of Cylinder Class & Sphere  

       Class and call the Show Method & show the output as Following
